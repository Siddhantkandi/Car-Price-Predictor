# Car-Price-Predictor


The project involves developing a car price prediction system using a RandomForest model integrated with a Tkinter-based GUI. Users input car features like year, brand, model, distance, fuel type, city, and car age. The system preprocesses and encodes this data to match the modelâ€™s training format, predicts the car's price, and displays the result. The project demonstrates machine learning model deployment with a user-friendly interface for real-time predictions.
